# Zyllabi

#### A crowd-sourced database of UC Irvine course syllabi.
Zyllabi hopes to demystify course loads by making course syllabi openly accessible and freely available. It hopes to reduce choice paralysis when signing up for classes and act as a reference for the inevitable time a professor tells you to "check the syllabus."
